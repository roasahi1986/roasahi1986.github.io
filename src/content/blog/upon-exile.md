That winter morn I saw them in the snow,  
Those castles proud, ablaze with golden glow,  
Their marble walls, their fragrant feasts within—  
But I was cast beyond, unnamed, alone.  

I'd served those lords and begged to serve them more,  
Had polished brass and swept the marble floor,  
But now the gates are shut, my place erased—  
A beggar where I'd been a guest before.  

Yet standing in the frost, I felt it clear:  
The chain that bound me shattered—so my fear.  
No longer must I kneel for wine and bread;  
I am my own, and that is why I'm here.  

So let them feast in towers touched with flame,  
Let trumpets sound and heralds cry my shame.  
I thank the frost that drove me from their door—  
For now I build a kingdom in my name.
