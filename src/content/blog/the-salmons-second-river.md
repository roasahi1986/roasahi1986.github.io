title: "The Salmon's Second River"
description: "People chase deadlines endlessly, moving from one task to the next, with no space for learning. Only when work disappears do they discover what was always there—ideas and skills that would have made them better at the very work they lost."

The waterfall knows only down,  
and speaks it till the rocks are worn.  
It thinks the world is speed and sound—  
it cannot hear the pool, reborn.  

The pool holds still, the pool holds deep.  
The salmon stirs a buried dream:  
a river swum before its sleep,  
a current older than the stream.  

The mill grinds on through harvest dark,  
the grain to flour, the flour to bread.  
But no one asks, when mills grow stark,  
where flour goes when it is dead.  

The millstone cracks. The axle rusts.  
A spider threads the broken spoke.  
She does not grieve what time adjusts—  
she names the emptiness: bespoke.  

The oak has never rushed a ring.  
Its shadow crosses every road.  
It stands through frost, it stands through spring,  
and bears the slowest kind of load.  

What waterfalls can never speak,  
the pool collects, a seed, a stone:  
that stillness is not faint or weak—  
it is the river, coming home.
