title: "The Crooked Shelter"
description: "I used to quarrel with my family over little things, never quite seeing eye to eye. But when I stumbled, I found them waiting—imperfect, yet unmistakably warm. Love doesn't have to be flawless to be real."

The nest is woven rough and wrong,  
with twigs too short and reeds too long.  
Yet still it holds against the rain—  
the eggs stay warm, the young remain.  

The oak bends east, the maple west,  
and neither knows the shape that's best.  
Their shade falls crooked on the ground—  
yet every root wraps warmly round.  

The brook flows shallow, runs askew,  
and cannot carve the channel through.  
It brings no torrent, brings no sweep—  
and waters only what will keep.  

The hive builds cells that lean and list,  
the angles wrong, the chambers missed.  
One cell collapses, wax and comb—  
the others hold. The queen comes home.  

No nest sits snug, no shade falls true,  
no brook runs straight the way it's due.  
But still the sparrow folds its wing  
beneath the shelter such things bring.
