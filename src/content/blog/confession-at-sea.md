title: "Confession at Sea"
description: "A confession of a shameful wish: while fearing punishment for my own transgressions, I fantasized that those more successful than me would suffer even worse. In the end, I may be the one who falls hardest—and the face I wore while wishing others to ruin is too ugly to bear."

We held the rail against the gale,  
two sinners lashed by wind and hail.  
He had the strength that I had not —  
I prayed to see his fingers fail.  

I wished his hands would lose their grip,  
I wished to see his courage slip.  
I dreamed that he would drown alone,  
while I sailed home on some safe ship.  

But it was I who fell that night,  
my frozen fingers lost the fight.  
I saw him lifted toward the stars —  
and sank still burning with my spite.  

What face I wore beneath the sea,  
what mask of envy over me —  
let this confess my wretched heart:  
I drowned still wishing him debris.
