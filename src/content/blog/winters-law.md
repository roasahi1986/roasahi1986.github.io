description: "Parkinson's Law through natural imagery: organizations expand endlessly until they ossify. Fortunately, economic cycles function like seasons—preventing stagnation and allowing ecosystems to grow increasingly diverse and beautiful."

The hive builds halls no bee will fill,  
each cell begets another cell.  
The comb expands by comb's own will—  
no drop of honey, none to sell.  

The pond sleeps long beneath the reed,  
the silt collects, the water slows.  
Then frost descends to crack the seed—  
and something older than the thaw knows.  

The dam gives way, the current wakes,  
the frozen vine releases hold.  
What summer sealed, the cold remakes—  
what summer hoards, the frost has sold.  

Now cherry blooms where oak once stood,  
the minnow threads the opened stream.  
The foxglove flames beside the wood—  
each ruin fathers a new dream.  

The fern divides the ash with moss,  
a hundred greens contest the floor.  
What seemed like death, what seemed like loss,  
becomes the seed of something more.  

So turns the wheel from freeze to thaw.  
The hive must fall, the vine must break.  
No root shall rule. This is the law:  
the land grows rich for winter's sake.
