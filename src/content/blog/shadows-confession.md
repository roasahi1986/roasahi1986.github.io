title: "Shadow's Confession"
description: "A confession of a shameful wish: while fearing punishment for my own transgressions, I fantasized that those more successful than me would suffer even worse. In the end, I may be the one who falls hardest—and the face I wore while wishing others to ruin is too ugly to bear."

The dusk descends, a stain upon my soul,  
Anxiety's tendrils take their cold control.  
I fear the fallout, the unraveling thread,  
And whisper prayers for what lies ahead.  

But in that dread, a darker thought takes hold,  
To see another's fortune overthrown and cold.  
Those who have climbed, now poised to fall below,  
A secret wish to witness their woe.  

I pictured ruin, a more grievous plight,  
Than any chaos threatening my own night.  
A twisted solace, a shameful, hidden glee,  
To see them broken, where I feared to be.  

But then a truth, a chilling, stark refrain,  
The deepest sorrow might be *my* own pain.  
The cruelest irony, a fate unseen,  
To be the victim of a wish so mean.  

This ugly longing, a venomous embrace,  
A haunting darkness mirrored in my face.  
I loathe the impulse, the venom in my heart,  
To tear another's world and life apart.  

Forgive me, then, this shadow's whispered plea,  
To cleanse the darkness dwelling within me.  
To banish envy, and the wicked, selfish thought,  
And seek redemption for the battles fought.  

Let compassion bloom where malice took its root,  
And find my peace in bearing honest fruit.  
No longer gazing at another's fall,  
But standing upright, answering conscience's call.
